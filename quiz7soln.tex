\question[8]\begin{changemargin}{0pt}{137.4803pt}
 A shoebox (with no lid) is to have a rectangular base with length double its width and an open top. You have 450 in${}^2$ of cardboard from which to make the box. What dimensions maximize its volume?\end{changemargin}\vspace{60pt}
\begin{proof}[Response]
	We draw the picture of figure one (note that the box is three-dimensional):\begin{figure}[h!]\begin{centering}
		\includegraphics[scale=.1,angle=270]{shittybox}\caption{A box with base-length twice its width and an open top}\end{centering}
	\end{figure}

The quantity we must maximize is $V=2w^2h$. Our given constraint is that the surface area is 450 in${}^2$. Going side-by-side, we calculate that the surface area is $2w^2+2wh+2*2wh=2w^2+6wh$, so we have the relation $450=2w^2+6wh$. We also have the endpoints $h\geq 0$, $w\geq 0$. We use our relation to find $$h=\frac{450-2w^2}{6w}=75w^{-1}-\frac{1}{3}w$$
Then, we use this to adjust our endpoint:
\begin{align*}
	h&\geq 0\\
	\implies 75w^{-1}-\frac{1}{3}w&\geq 0\\
	\implies 75-\frac{1}{3}w^2&\geq 0\\
	\implies 75&\geq \frac{1}{3}w^2\\
	\implies 225&\geq w^2\\
	\implies 15&\geq w
\end{align*}
Thus, we are optimizing on the interval $w\in [0,15]$. Finally, we use our form for $h$ to put $V$ in terms of $w$:
$$V(w)=2w^2h=2w^2(75w^{-1}-\frac{1}{3}w)=150w-\frac{2}{3}w^3$$
To find critical points, we find $V'(w)=150-2w^2$. We set it equal to $0$:
\begin{align*}
	0&=150-2w^2\\
	\implies 2w^2&=150\\
	\implies w^2&=75\\
	\implies w=\sqrt{75}=5\sqrt{3}
\end{align*}
We note as well that $V(0)=V(15)=0$. Since $w=5\sqrt{3}$ is our only critical point and $V(5\sqrt3)>0$, we have that it is our maximizing width. We then calculate for our maximizing $h$:\begin{align*}
	h&=\frac{75}{w}-\frac{w}{3}\\
	&=5\sqrt{3}-\frac{5}{3}\sqrt{3}=\frac{10\sqrt{3}}{3}
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\question Let $f(x)=x^3+x^2-2x-2$\begin{parts}\part[6] Determine the intervals of concavity and inflection points for $f$. \begin{proof}[Response] We find that $f''(x)=6x+2=6(x+\frac{1}{3})$. Thus, $f$ is concave down on $(-\infty,-\frac{1}{3})$ and concave up on $(-\frac{1}{3},\infty)$ with an inflection point at $x=-\frac{1}{3}$. 
		\end{proof}\vspace{1cm}
\part[6] Use Newton's method to estimate a \textbf{critical point} of $f$ to five decimal places with starting point $x_1=1/2$. \\\emph{(Hint: stop and read this question again before you start working on your answer).}
\begin{proof}[Response]
	Note that finding a \textbf{critical point} equates to finding a \textbf{zero} of the \textbf{derivative.} Thus, our set-up should be $$x_i=x_{i-1}-\frac{f'(x_i)}{f''(x_i)}$$
	Using this, we find:
	\begin{align*}
		x_1&=.5\\
		x_2&=.55\\
		x_3&=.548585\\
		x_4&=.548584\\
	\end{align*}
Thus, the answer we are looking for is $x\approx .54858$.
